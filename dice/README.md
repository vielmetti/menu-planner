# menu planning by rolling the dice

see the file "menu" in this directory, which makes
menu suggestions based on random picks of ingredients
from a few categories, and then looks for inspiration
from ingredient combinations.

requires "gshuf", which means that until i tweak
it will only work on macos. (use "shuf" instead on
linux).

based on some ideas I wrote down a dozen years ago.
